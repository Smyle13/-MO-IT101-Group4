# About

MotorPH was established in 2020 to provide private transportation options to Filipinos. Our goal is to be the first choice of Filipinos who are searching for competitive and affordable motorcycles.


## Project

A console-based Java project is a type of Java application that runs in a command-line interface (CLI) rather than in a graphical user interface (GUI). The program takes input and produces output via the command prompt or terminal window.

When a program is executed in a console or command-line interface, there is no visual interface for the user to interact with. Instead, the program reads input from the user via the command line and produces output by displaying text on the screen.

Because of the lack of visual interface, console-based Java projects are often used to perform specific, programmatic tasks rather than to interact with the user. One of the common use case could be processing text data, which could include things like reading in a text file, performing some kind of analysis on the text, and then outputting the results.
Another common use of console-based Java project could be performing calculations that can be done with the input given via command line arguments.
automation tasks such as running scheduled jobs, scripts that can be run by command line instead of GUI based one.

In short, console-based Java projects are useful for tasks that don't require a lot of user interaction and can be performed by reading input from the command line and outputting results to the screen.
